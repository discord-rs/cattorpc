# Catto-RPC
Custom Discord Rich Presence Selfbot ( Twitch Streaming Status) made in Javascript, works through token so you don't need Discord open.

# Changing RPC
The RPC will switch between set images/details every 30 seconds. You could modify the code to increase or decrease the timer, just keep in mind that 15 seconds is the minimum. 

# Free Hosting
You can host it for free through https://bot-hosting.net/?aff=349185757560307713, just affiliate 1 alt every week and you get free 24/7 hosting lol
If you don't have alts you can watch 10 videos a week too, it works great.
